### There's not much here yet but will be [developed over the next 1.5 months](https://github.com/tabcat/zzzync/issues/6)

Zzzync uses [IPLD](https://ipld.io/), [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/), and [Provider Records](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dht/) to replicate dynamic content over IPFS. Read about the design in [tabcat/dynamic-content](https://github.com/tabcat/dynamic-content).

IPLD is used to store replica data
IPNS is used to point to the latest version of a collaborator's local replica
Provider Records are used to find the [peerIDs](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/peers/#peer-id) of collaborators, which can be turned into IPNS names

This work is being funded as part of a [grant](https://github.com/tabcat/rough-opal) by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai)
