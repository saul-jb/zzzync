> sync with peers that have gone to sleep Zzz

This is replicator module for [Opal](https://github.com/cypsela/opal), built to allow persistent replication.

Zzzync works by coupling an immutable storage network with mutable pointers.
It uploads updated replicas to a storage network and has the pointer resolve to the roots of a Merkle-DAG.
IPNS/IPFS pinning services will be used in the short term, with the goal of moving toward services like ENS/Filecoin.
