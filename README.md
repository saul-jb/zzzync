This is a replicator module for [Welo](https://github.com/hldb/welo).

Zzzync uses an immutable storage network (IPFS) with signed, versioned documents (IPNS) to backup [HLDB](https://github.com/hldb) replicas.
Nodes upload their replicas and point the the latest version using IPFS/IPNS pinning services.
Afterwards data remains available while the node is offline. after the IPFS/IPNS replica and record have been pinned.
