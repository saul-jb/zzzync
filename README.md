This is replicator module for [Opal](https://github.com/cypsela/opal) that allows for persistent replication. Persistent replication is a way to replicate data that uses data types and protocols with persistence in mind.

Zzzync works by coupling an immutable storage network with a mutable, signed pointer.
It uploads updated replicas to a storage network and has the pointer resolve to the Merkle-DAG heads of the replica.
IPNS/IPFS pinning services will be used in the short term, with the goal of moving toward services like ENS/Filecoin.
